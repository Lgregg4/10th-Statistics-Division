Hmmm.. the photo u posed catched my eyes! pretty fun! the thing maybe it is more helpful what u write more about ur future plan? or career accomplishment? That's my opinions, casue there are only several sentences. 
 
###to katie:
I thought ur question about "cancer hospital" is a great question and I hope u could try ur best to solve it. And I am interested about ur classic drama in ur high school cause I never met before.
