# Team Work

## Overall Question:
How is general health related to weight and exercise?

It is commonly thought an individual in good health exercises frequently and has a lower weight. However, this is not always the case. It is important to compare general health with weight and exercise in order to determine if there is a correlation between the two and if any outliers exist.
