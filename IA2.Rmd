##Here is a Photo of Me:
![That's a picture of my friends and I in Banff National Park. I am third from the left.](https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/11707707_10207358605190076_4488943470225841164_o.jpg?oh=fa6437f2261ce832b5ac4f555690a2c0&oe=5AEEE1EE)

##A Question:
The Gross National Product (GNP) is a way of representing how much money people in a country have. In a similar vein, the Gross National Happiness (GNH) of a country can represent how happy the people in a country are. 

My question is: What conditions (government, culture, climate, etc...) make for the highest GNH of a country?

##What do I Want to be When I Grow Up?
###6 Months After Graduation:
  Just after I graduate I would love to travel around for a bit and find out where I want to live when I start my career. This likley won't last for 6 months, so 6 months after I graduate, I would love to be living in a place that I like. Hopefully I'd be settling into my new home, and working as an entry level data scientest. I would especially love it if I thought the work I was doing was meaningful and challenging. 
  
###Five Years After That:
  Five years after settling into my new home, I would love it if I had found a job that allowed me to travel. By this point it would be crucial that my job be meaningful. I want to feel like I am making the world a better place through what I am doing.

##What Do I Hope My Greatest Career Accomplishment Will Be?
I've recently started to think of staticians and data-scientests as sort of 'uncoverers of truth'. In the realm of consulting, a statician would look at the data from another scientest and let him know if there is any truth in his hypothesis. This is what I love. In this light, my greatest career accomplishment would be to help uncover some great (meaningful) truth.

##Hopes For the Course (given my hopes and goals):
* To learn the basics of programming in R
* To learn how to display data elequently 
* To further my collaboration skills
* To practice data analysis

##My Favorite Book Passage:
"It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again." [Kurt Vonnegut, 1969]
